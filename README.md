  * Bukatko/Daehler's CHILD DEVELOPMENT: A THEMATIC APPROACH provides a comprehensive, topically organized, up-to-date picture of development from conception to adolescence. Most important, it draws students' attention to the themes that replay themselves throughout the course of development, fundamental issues that resurface continually and that provide coherence to sometimes seemingly disparate research. The themes can serve as frameworks to help students further understand and remember the multitude of facts about child development. Bukatko/Daehler's sixth edition text draws on five themes, Nature and Nurture, Sociocultural Influence, Continuity/Discontinuity, Interaction among Domains, and Risk/Resilience.
